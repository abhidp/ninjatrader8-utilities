Some more UI improvements

in the Risk Reward Tool Panel:

the points for both Risk and Reward are shown in the line below and it make it look cluttered. There is a lot of empty space to the right. Please move the points to the right instead of displaying them on a line below. This will make the UI look cleaner and more organized.
