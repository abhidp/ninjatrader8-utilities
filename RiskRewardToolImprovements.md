Some more UI improvements

upon reviewing the UI/UX, i have made the followign observations and improvements:

1.) minor: the levels drag handles a bit big. Can we make it smaller?
2.) all the boxex on the right margin - Entry, Stop Loss, Take Profit and extremely right aligned and i see that the price text is getting cut off. Can we add some padding to the right so that the price text is fully visible? in other words, move the boxes a bit to the left so that the price text is fully visible and not getting cut off?
3.) the entry box feels a bit empty, because it just displays `ENTRY <price>`. I think we should also add the contract size below it. 
4.) can we also make the font size a bit bolder?
